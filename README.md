### I read something on the oem unlocking option in the developers options. Oem unlocking allows us to access features that are not available on android phones and to essentially bypass some initial security checks on android devices. The primary reason for OEM unlocking is to gain the ability to root your device or install custom firmware. I also read that it is similar to jailbreaking. I assume that for this class we will not use this feature since we will be sticking to the basics more or less and wont require and custom firmware or have a need for jailbreaking phones. I am not sure if having students OEM unlock would be allowed lol.
